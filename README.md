## Overview
Standard spatial contiguity models often leave significant portions of island nations mathematically isolated. In the Philippine context, standard Queen logic leaves 23 provinces (approx. 28%) orphaned, resulting in a fragmented network with only approximately 72% connectivity. This fragmentation introduces systematic predictive bias and significant residual spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Moran's I=0.024, p<0.05 for 'palay' price in the Philippines).

`ArchipelagoEngine` implements specialized K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) logic to bridge these fragmented maritime networks. By enforcing a unified grid (optimized at k=5 using the Philippines as case study), the engine achieves 100% network connectivity and neutralizes spatial bias, enabling robust econometric inference for fragmented topographies, public health mapping, among other applications.

  <b>Figure 1:</b> <i>Standard Queen Logic (Left) vs. ArchipelagoEngine k=5 (Right)</i>
</p>

**100% Connectivity**: Ensures no island units are mathematically isolated.

**Bias Neutralization**: Reduces Moran’s I to approximately 0 (p > 0.10) to stabilize spatial spillovers.

**Structural Robustness**: Prioritizes structural integrity and randomized residuals over superficial model fit.

**CRAN Verified**: Fully compatible with standard spatial regression workflows using `sf` and `spdep`.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **ArchipelagoEngine** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ArchipelagoEngine) with:

```R
install.packages("ArchipelagoEngine")
```
## Quick Start
The core function, build_archipelago_weight, bridges fragmented networks using optimized KNN logic.
```R
library(ArchipelagoEngine)
library(sf)
library(spdep)

# Load the benchmark map
data(raw_data)

# Calculate the new network based on the k=5 logic
weights <- build_archipelago_weight(raw_data, k = 5)

# Scans the graph to see if any islands are isolated
# If this returns 1, the computer has verified 100% connectivity
connectivity_status <- spdep::n.comp.nb(weights$neighbours)$nc
print(connectivity_status)

# Plot connectivity
plot(st_geometry(raw_data), border = "lightgrey")
plot(weights$neighbours, st_coordinates(st_centroid(raw_data)), 
     add = TRUE, col = "#1E90FF", pch = 19, cex = 0.5, lwd = 0.7)

# Result status
mtext(paste("Status: 100% Connectivity Achieved (nc =", connectivity_status, ")"), 
      side = 1, line = 1, adj = 0.5, cex = 0.9, font = 1, col = "#2C3E50")
```
## Documentation
For a deep dive into the underlying methodology— including applications of Anselin (1988) and LeSage and Pace (2009)— refer to [Case Study.](https://njtalingting.r-universe.dev/articles/ArchipelagoEngine/rtl_impact.html)

## Theoretical Framework
The development of ArchipelagoEngine is informed by the missing-neighbor problem 
in archipelagic topographies. While Anselin (1988) notes that weight matrix misspecification 
leads to biased estimators, LeSage and Pace (2009) emphasize the necessity of complete 
spatial weights to capture global spillovers. This engine bridges the gap between these 
classical theories and fragmented maritime realities.
