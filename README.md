Standard spatial contiguity models often leave significant portions of island nations mathematically isolated. In the Philippine context, standard Queen logic leaves 16 provinces (approx. 20%) orphaned, resulting in a fragmented network with only 80.2% connectivity. This fragmentation introduces systematic predictive bias and significant residual spatial autocorrelation (Moran's $I=0.024$, $p<0.05$)

`ArchipelagoEngine` implements specialized K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) logic to bridge these fragmented maritime networks. By enforcing a unified grid (optimized at $k=5$ for the Philippines), the engine achieves 100% network connectivity and neutralizes spatial bias, enabling robust econometric inference for fragmented topographies, public health mapping, among other applications.

## Key Features
* **100% Connectivity**: Ensures no island units are mathematically "orphaned."
* **Bias Neutralization**: Reduces Moran’s I to approximately 0 ($p > 0.10$) to stabilize spatial spillovers.
* **Structural Robustness**: Prioritizes structural integrity and randomized residuals over superficial model fit.
* **CRAN Verified**: Fully compatible with standard spatial regression workflows using `sf` and `spdep`.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **ArchipelagoEngine** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ArchipelagoEngine) with:

```R
install.packages("ArchipelagoEngine")

## Quick Start
The core function, build_archipelago_weight, bridges fragmented networks using optimized KNN logic.

library(ArchipelagoEngine)

# Load the included Philippine Provincial Map (81 Provinces)
data(raw_data)

# Build archipelagic spatial weights with 100% connectivity
weights <- build_archipelago_weight(raw_data, k=5)

# Verify connectivity (nc = 1)
spdep::n.comp.nb(weights$neighbours)$nc
```
## Research Roadmap
v0.1.1 (Current): Established topological baselines for fragmented islands.

Active Development: Transitioning from static to dynamic modeling by integrating scraped AIS (Automatic Identification System) satellite data.

Field Calibration: Currently ground-truthing maritime friction variables against real-world bottlenecks and monsoons at the Port of Cebu.
